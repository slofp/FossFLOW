## Note:
This repo is a fork of stan-smith/FossFLOW (which in turn was a fork of [markmanx/isoflow](https://github.com/markmanx/isoflow)) originally made for the purpose of contributing to the original repo through PRs, however the username of the author seems to have been changed to [mug-book-droid](https://github.com/mug-book-droid) and their activity set to private (account suspended maybe?), making the original repo inaccessible.

For now, I intend to make this repo a continuation of development to FossFLOW from myself, and any contributions through PRs are welcome as well. 

You can check out the last state of the original repo that I fetched on `backup/stan-smith-FossFLOW` branch.

FossFLOW is a powerful, open-source Progressive Web App (PWA) for creating beautiful isometric diagrams. Built with React and the <a href="https://github.com/markmanx/isoflow">Isoflow</a> (Now forked and published to NPM as fossflow) library, it runs entirely in your browser with offline support.

## 🐳 Quick Deploy with Docker

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended - includes persistent storage)
docker compose up

# Or run directly from Docker Hub with persistent storage
docker run -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/diagrams:/data/diagrams abrar74774/fossflow:latest
```

Server storage is enabled by default in Docker. Your diagrams will be saved (as root by default) to `./diagrams` on the host. To change user or group id for saving as, set the `PUID` and `PGID` env variables.

To disable server storage, set `ENABLE_SERVER_STORAGE=false`:
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -e ENABLE_SERVER_STORAGE=false abrar74774/fossflow:latest
```

### HTTP Basic Authentication (Optional)

Protect your FossFLOW instance with HTTP Basic Auth:

```bash
# With Docker Compose
HTTP_AUTH_USER=admin HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD=secret docker compose up

# Or with docker run
docker run -p 80:80 \
  -e HTTP_AUTH_USER=admin \
  -e HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD=secret \
  abrar74774/fossflow:latest
```

> **Note**: Both variables must be set to enable authentication. If either is empty, the app is accessible without login.

## ☁️ Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

`packages/fossflow-worker` serves the built app with Workers Static Assets and implements the same `/api` as the Docker backend, storing diagrams in R2. Every request (static files included) passes through the Worker's authentication.

Settings live in `vars` of [`packages/fossflow-worker/wrangler.jsonc`](packages/fossflow-worker/wrangler.jsonc):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ENABLE_SERVER_STORAGE` | `"true"` saves diagrams to the R2 bucket bound as `DIAGRAMS_BUCKET` (`STORAGE_PATH` is not used). `"false"` keeps diagrams in the browser session only. |
| `HTTP_AUTH_ENABLE` | `"true"`: HTTP Basic Auth with `HTTP_AUTH_USER` / `HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD`. `"false"` (default): only requests carrying a valid Cloudflare Access JWT are allowed. |
| `HTTP_AUTH_USER` / `HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD` | Basic Auth credentials. Store the password as a secret: `npx wrangler secret put HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD`. |
| `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` | Zero Trust team domain, e.g. `https://<your-team>.cloudflareaccess.com`. |
| `CF_ACCESS_AUD` | Application Audience (AUD) tag of the Access application that protects the Worker. |

If the settings for the selected auth mode are missing, every request is rejected with `500`.

```bash
npm install
cd packages/fossflow-worker
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler r2 bucket create fossflow-diagrams   # only when ENABLE_SERVER_STORAGE is "true"
# Edit wrangler.jsonc (and run `npx wrangler secret put HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD` when using Basic Auth)
cd ../..
npm run deploy:worker    # builds lib + app, then runs `wrangler deploy`
```

**Cloudflare Access (`HTTP_AUTH_ENABLE` = `"false"`)**: in Zero Trust, add a self-hosted Access application for the Worker's custom domain (or its `workers.dev` route), then copy the team domain and the application's AUD tag into `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` / `CF_ACCESS_AUD`. The Worker verifies the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header itself, so hostnames not covered by Access are rejected with `403`.

**Local development**: Access does not run in front of `wrangler dev`, so copy `packages/fossflow-worker/.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` (Basic Auth) and run `npm run dev:worker`. R2 is emulated locally.

**Migrating diagrams from Docker**: diagrams are stored as `<id>.json` at the bucket root, the same layout as `./diagrams`, so they can be copied as-is:

```bash
for f in diagrams/*.json; do
  npx wrangler r2 object put "fossflow-diagrams/$(basename "$f")" --file "$f" --remote
done
```

## Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Abrar74774/FossFLOW
cd FossFLOW

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the library (required first time)
npm run build:lib

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Monorepo Structure

This is a monorepo containing two packages:

- `packages/fossflow-lib` - React component library for drawing network diagrams (built with Webpack)
- `packages/fossflow-app` - Progressive Web App which wraps the lib and presents it (built with RSBuild)

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start app development server
npm run dev:lib      # Watch mode for library development

# Building
npm run build        # Build both library and app
npm run build:lib    # Build library only
npm run build:app    # Build app only

# Testing & Linting
npm test             # Run unit tests
npm run lint         # Check for linting errors

# E2E Tests (Selenium)
cd e2e-tests
./run-tests.sh       # Run end-to-end tests (requires Docker & Python)

# Publishing
npm run publish:lib  # Publish library to npm

# Cloudflare Workers
npm run dev:worker     # Build, then run the Worker locally (wrangler dev)
npm run deploy:worker  # Build, then deploy the Worker (wrangler deploy)
```

## How to Use

### Creating Diagrams

1. **Add Items**:
   - Press the "+" button on the top right menu, the library of components will appear on the left
   - Drag and drop components from the library onto the canvas
   - Or right-click on the grid and select "Add node"

2. **Connect Items**: 
   - Select the Connector tool (press 'C' or click connector icon)
   - **Click mode** (default): Click first node, then click second node
   - **Drag mode** (optional): Click and drag from first to second node
   - Switch modes in Settings → Connectors tab

3. **Save Your Work**:
   - **Quick Save** - Saves to browser session
   - **Export** - Download as JSON file
   - **Import** - Load from JSON file

### Storage Options

- **Session Storage**: Temporary saves cleared when browser closes
- **Export/Import**: Permanent storage as JSON files
- **Auto-Save**: Automatically saves changes every 5 seconds to session
